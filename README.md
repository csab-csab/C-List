# C-List 
This project impements a dynamic array type into C, behaving similarly to vectors in C++ or Lists in C# or other higher level languages. It works by using malloc and realloc to allocate and reallocate arrays, while keeping track of the data in them. It now supports char, int, float, double and long data types. 


# Background
This project was created as a learning excercise; to teach myself about pointers and memory allocation in a low-level language. This is my first ever proper C project so any feedback is welcome.
