# C-List 
This project impements a dynamic array type into C, behaving similarly to vectors in C++ or Lists in C# or other higher level languages. It works by using malloc and realloc to allocate and reallocate arrays, while keeping track of the data in them.

**Please note:** currently the list **only supports an int type**. I am planning on expanding this to any type soon.

# Background
This project was created as a learning excercise; to teach myself about pointers and memory allocation in a low-level language. This is my first ever proper C project so any feedback is welcome.
